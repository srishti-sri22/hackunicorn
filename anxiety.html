                        <h2>What is Anxiety?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Anxiety is your body’s natural response to stress. It’s a feeling of 
                            fear or apprehension about what’s to come. For example, going to a job 
                   interview or giving a speech on the first day of school may cause some people       to feel fearful and nervous.But if your feelings of anxiety are extreme, last for at least 6 months,
                and are interfering with your life, you may have an anxiety disorder.                        </p>

                        <h3>What are anxiety disorders?</h3>
               <p> It’s normal to feel anxious about moving to a new place, starting a new job, or
                taking a test. This type of anxiety is unpleasant, but it may motivate you to work 
                harder and do a better job. Ordinary anxiety is a feeling that comes and goes but
                 doesn’t interfere with your everyday life.
            In the case of an anxiety disorder, the feeling of fear may be with you all the time. 
            It’s intense and sometimes debilitating.
             This type of anxiety may cause you to stop doing things you enjoy. For example, 
             it may prevent you from entering an elevator, crossing the street, or even leaving your 
             home in extreme cases. 
             If left untreated, the anxiety will keep getting worse.  
             Anxiety disorders are the most common form of emotional disorder and can affect anyone.
              But, according to the American Psychiatric Association, women are more likely than men
               to receive a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder.
