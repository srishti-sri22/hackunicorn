                    <h2>What is insomnia</h2>
                    <p>Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder. Unlike many other medical conditions, 
        it has a relatively simple definition. “Insomnia means an inability to sleep,” says Gerard J. Meskill, MD, a neurologist and sleep disorders specialist with the Tricoastal Narcolepsy and Sleep Disorders Center in Texas. Characteristics of insomnia include not being able to fall asleep, not staying asleep throughout the night, and waking up too early in the morning.
         More specifically, there are two types of insomnia: acute and chronic. Acute insomnia means you have trouble sleeping for only a short period of time, even if that means only for one night. “Virtually everybody gets acute insomnia every once in a while,” Dr. Meskill says. But this insomnia is so short lasting that once the cause behind it disappears, you return to your normal sleep patterns. (3)
          Acute insomnia can still be a problem, however, because if ignored and not addressed it can lead to longer-term chronic insomnia</p>

                <h2>Treatments for Insomnia</h2>
                <p>Your GP will first try to identify and treat any underlying health condition, such as anxiety, that may be causing your sleep problems.

                    They'll probably also discuss things you can do at home that may help to improve your sleep.
                    
                    In some cases, a special type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) designed for people with insomnia (CBT-I) may be recommended.
                    
                    This is a type of talking therapy that aims to help you avoid the thoughts and behaviours affecting your sleep. It's usually the first treatment recommended and can help lead to long-term improvement of your sleep.
                    
                    Prescription sleeping tablets are usually only considered as a last resort and should be used for only a few days or weeks at a time.
                    
                    This is because they don't treat the cause of your insomnia and are associated with a number of side effects. They can also become less effective over time.
