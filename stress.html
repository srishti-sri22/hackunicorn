    <h2>What is Stress?</h2>
    <p> Stress can be defined as a state of worry or mental tension caused by a difficult situation.
        Stress is a natural human response that prompts us to address challenges and threats in our 
        lives. Everyone experiences stress to some degree. The way we respond to stress, however,
         makes a big difference to our overall well-being.

    <h2>How does Stress effect? </h2>
    <p>Stress makes it hard for us to relax and can come with a range of emotions, including anxiety
         and irritability. When stressed, we may find it difficult to concentrate. We may experience 
         headaches or other body pains, an upset stomach or trouble sleeping. We may find we lose
          our appetite or eat more than usual. Chronic stress can worsen pre-existing health problems
           and may increase our use of alcohol, tobacco and other substances.

        Stressful situations can also cause or exacerbate mental health conditions, most commonly 
        anxiety and depression, which require access to health care. When we suffer from a mental 
        health condition, it may be because our symptoms of stress have become persistent and have 
        started affecting our daily functioning, including at work or school.

          <h2>Treatments</h2>
          <p>Here some treatment of Stress:</p>
          <h3>Meditation and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction</h3>
          <p> Meditation and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) are therapies proven to help
               manage anxiety and depression.
  
              Meditation is an ancient practice that helps you reach a relaxed state by focusing on
               breathing and awareness of the body in the present.
              
              MBSR is a program that draws on the principles of meditation to help people become more 
              aware of how negative thoughts impact physical feelings. Research has shown that benefits
               of MBSR include:
              </p>
             <li>Reduced stress and worrying</li> 
          <li> Improved memory and focus</li> 
         <li> Fewer emotional ups and downs, and greater resilience</li> 
        <li> Improved relationships</li> 
        <p>Evidence supports the idea that meditation and mindfulness-based stress reduction are 
          very helpful for managing mood disorders, and experts recommend it.
        </p>
            <h3> Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</h3>
            <p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of talk therapy focused on pinpointing 
              and questioning negative, often mistaken thoughts that can lead to behavioral and mental health problems, such as anxiety
              Research shows that people who receive CBT have a greater reduction in mental health 
              symptoms as compared to people who use medication alone. 
              There is solid evidence that CBT, meditation and MBSR are effective. 
              All of these techniques are safe and have no side effects. A motivated person can 
              practice them on their own. While integrative medicine may support traditional medicine, it is not a replacement,
               so itâ€™s important to talk to your doctor about your symptoms.
              </p>
              <h3> Acupuncture</h3>
              <p> Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese practice involving the use of tiny needles to
           stimulate the nervous and immune systems. During the procedure, a licensed 
              acupuncturist inserts hair-thin needles into the skin at specific points on 
              the body. Acupuncture is painless, and research shows it helps support conventional 
           treatment for a range of problems that include stress, chronic pain and digestive 
              disorders. Experts note that it may be particularly effective for insomnia.
           </p>
              <h3>Massage </h3>
              <p>While many of us think of massage as a rare, indulgent treat, studies indicate
                   massage helps treat a variety of stress-related disorders, including anxiety 
                   and insomnia. While one treatment is good, a series of massage treatments can be
                    even more effective.
  
                  It's important to talk to your doctor about whether massage is right for you. 
                  It may not be appropriate for people with certain conditions, such as bleeding
                   disorders or osteoporosis.</p>
