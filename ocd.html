                    <h2>what is OCD?</h2>
                <p>Other Health Disabilities (OHD) includes a wide range of chronic or acute health conditions, including Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD), that can range from mild to severe. Medications, treatments, therapies and repeated hospitalizations can affect a student’s ability to learn and function at school. A student with such a condition may be considered for special education under the OHD category. Find Minnesota Rule language regarding other health disabilities and resources, including the OHD Manual, under Related offsite resources on the right.

                    Prepared for educators, the information sheets linked on this page contain information about some of the conditions that may be included in the OHD category, and ways that each condition might affect a student in the educational setting.

                <h2>What cause OHD?</h2>

                    Other anxiety problems, depression, eating disorders, or substance use disorder may happen with OCD.</p>
